Create a new Java class named Calculator in the package lesson2.ismayil.

Inside the Calculator class, define the following methods:

boolean checkIfAdult(int age): This method should return true if the given age is 18 or above; otherwise, return false.

int toplama(int a, int b): This method should take two integers as parameters and return their sum.

int cixma(int a, int b): This method should take two integers as parameters and return the result of subtracting the second from the first.

String salamUser(String user): This method should take a String parameter representing a user's name and return a greeting message like "Salam [user]".

int vurma(int a, int b): This method should take two integers as parameters and return their product.

int bolme(int a, int b): This method should take two integers as parameters and return the result of dividing the first by the second.

Copy and paste the main method provided in the template, ensuring that it interacts with an instance of the Calculator class and demonstrates the functionality of each method.

Test your Calculator class by running the main method and providing inputs when prompted.
